//Function: This function goes through a text file given as a command line argument and with each 
//word it removes all the punctuation within the word. Then, the program checks to see if the word is 
//greater than or equal to 10 characters. Once a word has been found with that number of characters,
//all its letters are made capital. Finally, the word is printed out to the screen and the program 
//continues searching through the text file until another word is found that is greater than or equal to 
//10 characters and the process repeats itself. Once the entire file has been read, the program ends.
//
//Efficiency: O(n) where n is the number of words in a given text file.
//
//Return type: An integer, in this case, the value of 0.
//
//Precondition: A text file must exist that can be read through. With no text file, the program
//cannot be run.
//
//Postcondition: The words in a given file that are greater than or equal to 10 characters 
//will be printed out to the screen with each word being changed to all caps and having all
//puncuation and spaces removed from the words. Each word printed out will have its own line.
